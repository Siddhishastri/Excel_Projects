![sales_dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/668cf801-2909-4eb1-bf82-2f74250191ba)

This project involves designing an interactive and insightful Sales Dashboard in Microsoft Excel to analyze e-commerce sales data. The goal is to enable users to explore trends in sales and profits across various product categories, regions, and months.

## Project Objective

The primary objective is to analyze sales data and create a user-friendly dashboard that allows users to:

* View trends month-by-month and product-by-product.
* Filter and explore sales based on product categories.
* Visualize key metrics and patterns for better decision-making.

## Dataset Description

* The dataset includes detailed sales information with the following key variables:
* Order Details: Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode, and Order Priority.
* Customer Information: Customer ID, Customer Name, City, State, Country, and Region.
* Product Information: Product Category, Product Name.
* Sales Metrics: Sales, Profit, Discount, Quantity, Shipping Cost, and Aging (days to ship an order).
* Months: The month when the order was placed.

## Key Features of the Dashboard
### Metrics
The dashboard provides the following key insights and summaries:

* Total Sales and Profits: Month-wise and region-wise breakdown.
* Sales by Product Categories: Filterable using a dynamic combo box.
* Shipping Aging Analysis: Histogram showcasing shipping days.
### Visualizations
* Column Charts:
    * Month-wise and region-wise sales performance.
* Histogram:
    * Distribution of shipping days (Aging).
* Combo Box:
    * User control to filter sales by product category.
### Calculations
* Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for predicting and comparing actual and predicted sales.

## Steps and Tasks Performed
1. Data Analysis:

* Created a histogram for shipping days to analyze delivery timelines.
* Prepared tables for sales and profit trends (month-wise and region-wise).

2. Interactive Features:

* Designed a combo box to allow users to filter and view trends by product categories.

3. Visualization:

* Created charts (column and histogram) to represent data insights dynamically.

4. Dashboard Creation:

* Built an Excel dashboard to consolidate all metrics and visualizations.
* Linked charts and tables to interactive controls like the combo box.

## Insights Derived
* Trends by Month and Region:
    * Sales and profits vary significantly month-by-month and region-by-region.
* Shipping Aging:
    * Histogram analysis highlights delivery efficiency.
* Category-wise Performance:
    * Certain product categories contribute more significantly to overall sales and profits.
* Model Accuracy:
    * Calculated RMSE to compare predicted and actual sales, ensuring data reliability.

## Prerequisites
To fully understand and implement the project:
* Basic knowledge of creating charts and graphs in Excel.
* Familiarity with data formatting and analysis tools in Excel.

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. Open the Excel File:
* Load the provided dashboard file.
2. Explore Filters:
* Use the combo box to filter sales by product category.
3. Analyze Trends:
* View month-wise and product-wise trends through interactive charts.
4. Insights at a Glance:
* Access KPIs and performance metrics directly from the dashboard.

## Outcome
The dashboard successfully enables users to:

* Monitor sales and profits dynamically.
* Analyze shipping efficiency.
* Identify high-performing and low-performing product categories.

This project showcases how Excel can be used for powerful data visualization and actionable business insights.
